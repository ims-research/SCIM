Service Capability Interaction Manager (SCIM)

This project forms part of a larger investigation into Dynamic Service Orchestration in the IP Multimedia Subsystem.

The Service Capability Interaction Manager acts as the intelligent routing agent in the proposed system. It controls the flow of SIP signalling for any enhanced services. It makes these decisions based on the contextual information that it has received from the CS together with the desired scenarios that have been created and transferred from the USPS.

There is no documentation at the moment. Please leave some feedback if you are interested in the project.
